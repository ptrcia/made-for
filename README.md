# MadeFor
Tiny videogame project in Unity3D

##  About:

Made for is a little game that talks about routine, loneliness, sadness and life. Above all I want to convey that, despite all that, life has priceless, unforgettable moments and that it is worth it. It may be that you have a horrible job or that you had a bad childhood, but with help you can move forward, overcome problems and be able to uncover the blindfold and see a world full of life, happiness, fraternity and solidarity.

The world is ugly, yes. But it can always be made a little more beautiful. 
If you have problems or do not see that light, **please ask for help**.
